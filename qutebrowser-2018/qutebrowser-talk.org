* Why Keyboard?
- Much faster
- Fewer and less jarring context switches
- Better Ergonomics
- More enjoyable to use!

* A little History
- Once upon a time, there were two primary choices
  + Vimperator
  + Pentadanctyl
  + (also dwb but ignore that for now)
- These managed to turn a previously mouse-based interface into a keyboard based one
** Hinting

** Completion

** Customizable
- Not exactly the best language, but it worked
#+BEGIN_SRC vimrc
  " map settings I like
  map H :tabprevious<CR>
  map J :back<CR>
  map K :forward<CR>
  map L :tabnext<CR>

  " map moving tabs
  map <A-h> :tabmove! -1<CR>
  map <A-l> :tabmove! +1<CR>

  " Don't use F1
  map <F1> <Esc>

  " Re-enable bottom bar during certain commands.
  noremap : :js updateBottomBar(false)<CR>:
#+END_SRC

* What Do I Pick?

** Why Standalone
- Standalone
  - Need to install a new browser, there will be setup.
  - They can intercept all keys, and are not limited by being an extension (and
    will never break)
  - Provide many features that browser extensions never can
- Browser Extensions
  - They work in your existing browser, easy to install
  - Cannot work in new tab/setting pages
  - Cannot intercept some keys (Ctrl-d, Ctrl-q)
  - Do not work until a page has loaded
** Why Qutebrowser
- Has multiple backends, pick between qtwebkit or qtwebengine (chromium)
- Has both a 'hands off' and a 'hands on' config language
- Comes with working native tabs by default, which you can turn off optionally.
- By far the most active of all the keyboard browsers, 2x as many contributors
  as the next most popular one.
- Self-documenting help system
- Extremely fast, fluid completion
- Userscripts - build your own commands in any language!
* What about my extensions?
Overall, you'll need to put in a bit of time configuring things to be the way
you'd like.
- Built in host-based adblocker
- Built in css override
- Userscripts
- Greasemonkey support
* Demo!
- Please ask questions (or feature requests) as things go along...

** Stuff to Go Over                                               :noexport:
*** Basic Browsing
- ~:open (-t)~
- completion
- bookmarks/quickmarks
- tab management
- ~:buffer~ alternative
- downloads
*** Intermediate Configuration
- Move tabbar to side
- Hide tabbar/statusbar when not tabbing
- Change colors of everything
- ~autoconfig.yml~ vs ~config.py~
*** Cool Settings
- lock fullscreen videos down to the page (~content.windowed_fullscreen~)
- searchengines, goes well with ddg bangs
*** Advanced Features
- ~:spawn~ to launch mpv on youtube
- readability userscript
- launch an external editor
- build a js cycler userscript

* Possible Future Features
- Per domain settings (for noscript and stylus like functionality)
- Tree style tabs?
- What do you want in a browser?

* Questions?
